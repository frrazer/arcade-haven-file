## 👀 thinking of making a game with this file?

don’t. seriously. it’s crawling with unpatched dupes, network jank, and security holes, we’re probably gonna exploit them just for fun.
BUT if you add cool updates or new content, we’d love to see it. drop a [new issue](https://github.com/frrazer/arcade-haven-file/issues/new) to show it off.

## 📦 About This Release

This is an early, unpolished version of **Arcade Haven**, a Roblox game originally developed by [Frazer](https://github.com/frrazer) under **Novaware**.
It’s not representative of current Novaware projects—especially not [**Fortune Frenzy**](https://github.com/NovawareRBX/fortune-frenzy-internal) - but has been released to help other developers learn from the project's history, systems, and structure.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- Early GUI and item systems  
- Trading and inventory experiments  
- Core game loop prototypes  
- Raw client-side scripting  
- Spaghetti code galore 🍝

If you're expecting clean structure or modern patterns—this ain't it 😭

## 🚀 Want to See the Glow-Up?

Check out the open-source backend for **Fortune Frenzy**—our current flagship title:

👉 [github.com/NovawareRBX/fortune-frenzy-internal](https://github.com/NovawareRBX/fortune-frenzy-internal)

This is a modern, scalable TypeScript backend that powers real-time trading, case opening, and more across thousands of users.

## 🧠 Final Notes

This legacy drop is part of a commitment to transparency, growth, and giving back to the developer community.

It’s a snapshot of what came before—proof that progress takes time, and that even messy beginnings can lead to polished, production-grade systems.

Thanks for checking it out.
