### 🥚 *The Easter File*

> ⚠️ requires heavy setup. nothing works out-of-the-box.
> the external API is [open source](https://github.com/frrazer/ArcadeHavenAPI) if you're brave.

comes with robux marketplace, updated item data, live coinflip, and all the fun stuff you remember.

### 📦 *The Regular File*

> ⚠️ works out-of-the-box, but is stripped down.
> advanced features like marketplace/inventory rely on old mongo cluster configs and probably won't work.

includes case battles, old coinflip, and some dusty minigames.
